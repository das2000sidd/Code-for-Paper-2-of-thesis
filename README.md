# Code-for-Paper-2-of-thesis
This is the example of set of R scripts used for paper 2 of PhD thesis titled "Exposure to particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers in 9 year-old children is associated with expression of genes related to viral and microbial infection". The analysis done in these scripts include differential expression analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and visualisation using volcano plots.

This project utilised gene expression data of children assayed from lymphoblastoid cell line using microaarray technology and the RNA sequencing data from the Generation R data. The data was accessed as part of the Longitools consortium and access was granted to the proposal to work on the datasets by relevant cohorts proposal reviewal commitee.
